(You wake up in an abandoned house. When you look up, you see a mysterious figure. You blink, and then it dissapears. What do you do?)
(You go downstairs, and you see the door open. It looks very bright outside through the windows.)
(You go outside of your house. It's really dark. It looks like a storm just happened.)
(The thing, or person, dropped a note for you. It said "7/3/01". Those numbers seem familiar, but you can't remember. It also had an arrow, pointing to your left.)
(Your back hurts, since you didn't have a comfortable sleep. You look for somewhere you can rest comfortably. There's a cave nearby.)
(When you wake up, the figure flickers in front of you again, leaving another note. The note said "Come farther in the cave." You do what the note says.)
(You see the figure. It takes off it's mask. You see that it was your brother. That's what the date meant- your brother's birthday.)
("I don't want to fight, but we must. If I don't, then they will." your brother said. "Who's 'they'?" you asked. Your brother ran up to you and started throwing punches.)
